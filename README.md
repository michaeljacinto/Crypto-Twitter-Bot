# Crypto-Twitter-Bot

A Python bot that tweets out the prices of selected cryptocurrencies and inputs data into a spreadsheet every desired number of minutes. Here is the **[Twitter account](https://twitter.com/script_crypto)** connected to my script.

Usage: python crypto-price-script \<minutes> \<coin\> <coin\>*
       
    e.g. python crypto-price-script 5 BTC ETH LTC
    This will tweet the price of BTC, ETH and LTC every 5 minutes to an account.
